# AlbertaSat

>*AlbertaSat is a group of students and faculty at the University of Alberta that have come together to design, build, test, launch and operate satellites. Our goal is to support a commercial space industry, global space culture, global space expansionism and global space education through our missions in space. - https://albertasat.ca/*

In this repository we are attempting to make a functional and extendable ground station for use by the operators of the [Ex-Alta 2 satellite](https://albertasat.ca/ex-alta-2/).
